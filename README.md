# Data wrangling on OpenStreetMaps data
In this project -- which is part of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree -- I will apply some data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean an specific area from OpenStreetMap data. After it, in order to try database manipulation in Python, I will load the cleaned data to a MongoDB collection (installed locally in my machine) and apply some simple statistics on it.

Please read the OpenStreetMaps_DataWrangling/exploringData.html for further informations.
